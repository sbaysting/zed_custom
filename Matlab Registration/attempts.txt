Attempt 1:

Box grid filter (10 cm)
De-noise the point cloud before stitching
- Added de-noise functions after reading the point clouds

Result:
- Much more defined features and less duplicate feature overlap


Attempt 2:

Different filtering: VoxelGrid Filter
Used C++ PCL Code to filter to data before going to matlab
Once in matlab, its de-noised and filtered again with a box grid filter

Result:
- Better result than attempt 1, less overlap
- Much faster because the points are downsampled twice (surprisingly less points is making it more accurate)
- FASTER (much emphasize this. I didn't sit here for 20 minutes waiting for a result)
- Execution time for 12 clouds (excluding VoxelGrid filtering time, which was fairly fast): 58.557601 seconds


Attempt 3:
VoxelGrid Filter without the second downsampling in matlab

Result:
- Practically no difference from attempt 2
- Execution time for 12 clouds (excluding VoxelGrid filtering time, which was fairly fast): 55.493519 seconds


Attempt 4:
Same as attempt 2 except changed the box grid window to be smaller (decreased window to 1cm from 10cm).
Its already filtered a bunch of points from the VoxelGrid filter so it should be able to handle a smaller grid window

Result:
- Because it's already been filtered and the box is so small, it didn't remove many more points, resulting in a very similar image to attempts 2 and 3
- Execution time for 12 clouds (excluding VoxelGrid filtering time, which was fairly fast): 61.311801 seconds


Attempt 5:
Same as attempt 2 except changed the box grid window to be larger (increased window from 10cm from 50cm).
Should filter more points with a larger grid

Result:
- Didn't improve the stitch, just made features more fuzzy because more points were filtered out
- Execution time for 12 clouds (excluding VoxelGrid filtering time, which was fairly fast): 62.732380 seconds


Attempt 6:
Box grid (no VoxelGrid) with a 50cm window

Result
- Slow
- Not much difference
- Execution time for 12 clouds: 507.167356 seconds


INTERESTING FIND: PCL PassThrough Filter (filtering along a specified dimension) (cut off values that are either inside or outside a given range) -- COLLISION AVOIDANCE



THE WINNER: ATTEMPT 3

Time to VoxelGrid Filter the data (12 clouds): 29.63s
